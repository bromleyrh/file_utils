TODO

- Factor out common code shared between replicate and verify into a shared
  library, or create single executable with multiple modes of operation

replicate

- Add option not to override "ro" /etc/fstab option for target
- Add command-line option to specify configuration file path
- Determine if safe to set block device read-only immediately after mount
- Improve diagnostic output
- Investigate options (if any) for exploiting parallelism

verify

- Modify to output file size and hash of first 512 bytes of file
- Allow selection of different hash algorithms
- Modify to reuse hash context instead of re-initializing
