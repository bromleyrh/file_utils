TODO

- Factor out common code shared between replicate and verify into a shared
  library, or create single executable with multiple modes of operation
- Exploit parallelism in replicate and verify using threads with suitable
  scheduling parameters

replicate

- Read from source concurrently with write to destination
- Use direct I/O
- Determine if safe to set block device read-only immediately after mount
- Improve diagnostic output

verify

- Allow selection of different hash algorithms
